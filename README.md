### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a research technician for Han Lab (https://transposon.tulane.edu/) and a Master's student of Computer Science at Tulane University.
My main interests are Computational biology / bioinformatics, but I am also interested in AI/ML. I'm currently working on identifying and locating L1 retrotransposons in next-gen sequencing data and visualizng L1 expression.

You can contact me at: edartez1@tulane.edu
